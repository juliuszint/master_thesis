Hi Julius,

> 1) What replay attack does the freshness token prevent?

The freshness token is an attempt to avoid revealing the TOTP seed to
an attacker, thus making it harder for them to mount a specific
multi-stage attack -- creating a malicious AEM device (and making the
owner use it) showing the correct TOTP code but leaking the LUKS
password back to the attacker.
It serves as an extra layer of protection for cases where an attacker
manages to steal or copy (one of) the AEM boot device(s), but only
gets to access the Qubes machine later, after it was rebooted by the
owner using the copied AEM device at least once (at which point the
freshness token of the copied device is invalidated, so attacker
cannot boot the target Qubes machine using the stolen AEM device to
learn the TOTP seed).
Additionally, if the owner notices a missing AEM device, they can
manually revoke its freshness token as detailed in [1].

> 2) For what reason is the TPM provisioned with a ID?

The TPM ID is used to enable a specific use-case: having a single AEM
boot device and multiple Qubes machines. This way, AEM can correctly
pick the corresponding set of secrets give to the TPM to unseal.

Hope my answers were clear enough. Feel free to ask more should
you need to.
Best of luck with your thesis! I would be interested in reading it
once it's done.
Cheers,
Patrik
